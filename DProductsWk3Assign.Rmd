## Data Products Plotly Graph
This assignment will present a plotly graph based on the well-known cars data file 


## Graph of cars data comparing cylinders to mpg and number of gears
```{R CARS, echo = FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
      cars=mtcars
      cars$gear <- as.factor(cars$gear)
      cars$am <- as.factor(cars$am)
      cars$cyl <- as.factor(cars$cyl)
      plot_ly(cars,x=~cyl,y=~mpg,color=~gear,name="Gear",mode='markers',type='scatter')
